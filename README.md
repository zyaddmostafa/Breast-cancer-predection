# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project implements a machine learning-based web application for breast cancer classification using multiple models including SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application file
- `Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing model training and analysis
- `breast-cancer.csv`: Dataset used for training
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates
- `static/`: Contains CSS and other static files
- Various `.pkl` files: Trained models and scaler

## Models
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`

## Usage
Access the web interface to input breast cancer diagnostic measurements and get predictions from different models.
